SIFT Feature Detection and Object Localization
Overview
This project implements a feature detection and object localization system using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. The system detects keypoints in images, matches these keypoints between a template and a scene image, and localizes the object from the template within the scene. The resulting image with keypoint matches and object boundaries is saved as the output.
